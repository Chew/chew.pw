<h2>What is Wordle?</h2>

<p>
  Wordle is a brand new game taking the internet by storm. If you've ever played Hit and Blow and love word puzzles,
  you'll catch on very easily!<br>
  You must guess the word in as few guesses as possible, but only up to 6 tries. If you guess the word, you win!<br>
  Every word you try, you are given 3 colors. A green means the letter is in the word, and it's the right spot! If this
  happens, you can enter it in the right spot above.<br>
  If you get a yellow letter, this means the letter is in the word, but it may be there more than once.
  You can enter these letters in the "confirmed/required" box above.<br>
  Any other letter, dark grey, means the letter is not in the word.<br>
  Enter any letters you can play into the "possible letters" box above.
  This means any letter that you haven't tried yet.
